## Queue With Stacks

A stack is a type of data structure in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The user can only acces the top of the Stack.  The order in which nodes are and added are Last In First Out (LIFO). A Queue is similar to a Stack except there is access to the First and the Rear nodes.  The order which nodes are added and removed are First In First Out (FIFO).

## Challenge
Create a new Queue class. Using two Stack instances, implement this Queue with the Enqueue and Dequeue methods using the *First In First Out* approach.
