# Reverse List

## Challenge
Write a method called Reverse() that accepts a singly linked list and returns the list but in reverse order.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(1)
	- The iterative approach to reversing the array remains linear because constants are not taken into consideration.  Space remains O(1) since no new data structures are created.
