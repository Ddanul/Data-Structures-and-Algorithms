## FIFO Animal Shelter

A Queue is similar to a Stack except there is access to the First and the Rear nodes.  The order which nodes are added and removed are First In First Out (FIFO). Its methods are enqueue and dequeue which add to the rear and remove from the front, respectively.

## Challenge
Create a new Queue class representing an Animal Shelter that takes in Cats and Dogs as objects. Enqueue these animals into the queue in the order that they come in.  Add a Dequeue method that accepts a preference of either a cat or a dog and depending on this argument, remove and return the cat/dog that has been in the shelter the longest.
