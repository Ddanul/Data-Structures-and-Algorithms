## FizzBuzz Tree

This method utilizes the properties of a tree.  Using recursion and traversing the tree In-Order we check the values of each node.

## Approach and Efficiency
* Time: O(n) since it traverses through each node <br/>
* Space: O(h) since a depends on the height of the tree.

## Challenge
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument. Determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and display Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz in the console of each of the nodes respectively. Return a list with the new values.
