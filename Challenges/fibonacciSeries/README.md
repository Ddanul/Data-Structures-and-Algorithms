# Fibonacci Series

## Challenge
Write a method called FindFibNumber that accepts an integer and returns the associated value within the Fibonacci series.

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(1)
	- The iterative approach to binary search comes with a n time because the number of times the code has to loop depends on the number passed in. Since no other space is being analyzed or used, it stays at O(1).
