## Singly Linked Lists

A stack is a type of data structure in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The user can only acces the top of the Stack.  The order in whic nodes are and added are Last In First Out (LIFO). A Queue is similar to a Stack except there is access to the First and the Rear nodes.  The order which nodes are added and removed are First In First Out (FIFO).

## Challenge
Create classes for Node, Stack, and Queue and implement their respective methods. (Peek, Push, Pop, Enqueue, Dequeue).

## Examples of Use
1. Stacks can be used when using the 'undo' button on a drawing app.
2. Queues can be used such as the printing queue on a printer.  The first one to enter the printer in a series is the first one to get printed.
