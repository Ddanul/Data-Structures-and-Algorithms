## Trees

Binary Trees are trees that only contain nodes who’s value are numeric types. There is not a specific sorting order for a binary tree. When adding a node to a binary tree, you are not restricted on the node’s location. A binary search tree, however, is a type of tree that does have structure attached to it. In a binary search tree, the tree is organized in a manner where all numbers that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all numbers that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

## Challenge
* Create a BinaryTree class and define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which takes in a root node, and returns an array of the nodes.

* Create a BinarySearchTree class and define a method named add that adds a new node in the correct location in the binary search tree as well as a method named search that brings in a value of node, and returns the node with the desired value.

## Examples of Use
1. Binary trees can be used for sorting and for mapping.
