## Singly Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Challenge
Create a linked list and node class and construct methods to Add, Print, Append, AddBefore, and AddAfter.

## Methods
### Add (O(1))
Takes in a Node object and adds it to the beginning of a singly linked list.

## Print (O(n))
Prints out all values in a singly linked list:
EX. - 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> Null

## Append(O(n))
Takes in a Node object and adds it to the end of a singly linked list.

## AddBefore(O(n))
Takes in two Node objects, first is the node to be added, the second is the node which is used for reference to be added in front of within the list.

## AddAfter(O(n))
Takes in two Node objects, first is the node to be added, the second is the node which is used for reference to be added behind within the list.
